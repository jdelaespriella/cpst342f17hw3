### Ojective 3 - Donna's Feedback
While bootstrap is easier to download, linking it to the html page was difficult . Everything I tried, by example, I found myself doing extra coding. But because I've never had experience with coding, I had a hard time understanding where and how to write the codes. I wish there was a section in the book regarding Bootstrap.

The style css was a easier. Using the examples the professor used in class and watching other examples as well as reading,  I was able to use style code easily.  The directions given on the homework 2 was pretty straight forward.  Using the style link, I was able to link both Jose and my page onto one page.

### Objective 3 - Jose's Feedback
Understanding using the grid's was a little more difficult that I expected, either way. 
Understanding the grid structure was not that difficult, but implementing it in HTML and CSS was puzzling. 

I found a great resource that explained how to create the grid layout in CSS. It was very clear and straightforward and became very easy to use.
I was able to wrap my head around creating the website and grid in this way. 
The code was very clean and easy to wrap my head around. 
However, the end-result website looks very barebones. 

On the other hand, bootstrap seemed overbearing at the beginning.
When I first started to research how to use bootstrap it seemed extremely confusing.
However, when I started looking at the example files bootstrap provided it started coming together.
Once I started tinkering with the templates it started making sense.
Our end result about.html page turned out to be much cleaner/ easier on the eyes than out index.html page.
